Iambic-JS
=========

Iambic-JS is a [PEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)-based parser compiler with error recovery for JavaScript, in the style of the [Iambic](//github.com/naucera/iambic) parser library.

Iambic-JS (and the parsers it generates) may be considered as a [Packrat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)-style recursive descent parser with infinite lookahead having O(n) time and space complexity.

Tagged releases (minified and gzipped) can be found in the [downloads](//github.com/naucera/iambic-js/downloads).
